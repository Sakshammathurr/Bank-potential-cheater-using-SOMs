Implementing bank fraud detection using self-organizing maps

Bank fraud is a serious issue that can lead to significant financial losses for both the bank and its customers. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) can be a powerful tool for detecting bank fraud by creating a model of normal transaction behavior and identifying any anomalies that fall outside of the expected pattern.

We can use the preprocessed data to train the SOM model. The SOM model will automatically group the transactions into clusters based on their similarity. During training, the SOM model learns the underlying patterns and structure of the data, allowing it to identify any transactions that deviate from the expected pattern.
Once the model is trained, any new transaction can be fed to the model to check if it falls outside the expected pattern. If the transaction is flagged as an outlier or is not in line with the expected behavior, it may be considered as a potential fraud and further investigation can be initiated.
